# Facebook-Clone (under progress)

This is a basic clone of the social media website Facebook.

### Current Live Version:

[Facebook Clone](https://rcamach7.github.io/facebook-clone/).
![Web App](appDemo.png)

#### Built Using:

- React Framework
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

#### Local Installation & Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcamach7/facebook-clone.git
cd facebook-clone
npm install
npm run start
```

## Next Steps:

- Have a call to our DB to query all posts and display from there, instead of from test data file.

### Bugs

- Posting a comment sends two posts to DB with different postId's

#### Improvements

- Add Emoji and Comment Enhancement icons at the end of add a comment bar for nicer UI
- When in mobile view - have the post take up 95%+ of the available width
- Rename App.js handle post / comment like name to be more specific to avoid confusion
